# Share System Feature

## Overview

The Waffle Game now includes a comprehensive share system that allows players to share their achievements and progress across multiple social media platforms and communication channels.

## Features

### üöÄ Multi-Platform Sharing
- **Twitter** - Share with hashtags and game URLs
- **Facebook** - Post to timeline with game results
- **LinkedIn** - Professional sharing with achievements
- **WhatsApp** - Quick messaging to friends
- **Email** - Detailed sharing via email clients
- **Copy Link** - Copy formatted text and URL to clipboard

### üì± Native Share API Support
- Automatically detects device capabilities
- Uses native share dialog when available (mobile devices)
- Falls back to platform-specific sharing on desktop

### üéØ Strategic Placement
Following industry best practices, share buttons are strategically placed in:

1. **Game End Dialog** - Primary sharing location when players complete puzzles
2. **Statistics Page** - Share overall achievements and statistics
3. **Game Header** - Quick access sharing during gameplay

## Implementation

### Core Components

#### ShareDialog Component
```typescript
interface ShareDialogProps {
  trigger?: React.ReactNode;
  shareData: ShareData;
  isOpen?: boolean;
  onOpenChange?: (open: boolean) => void;
  title?: string;
  description?: string;
}
```

#### Share Data Structure
```typescript
interface ShareData {
  gameStatus: 'won' | 'lost';
  moveCount: number;
  maxMoves: number;
  rating?: {
    emoji: string;
    text: string;
    color: string;
  };
  totalGames?: number;
  winRate?: number;
  currentStreak?: number;
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

1. **React.memo** - Prevents unnecessary re-renders
2. **useMemo** - Caches expensive calculations and platform configurations
3. **useCallback** - Optimizes event handlers
4. **Lazy Loading** - Share dialog only renders when opened
5. **Web APIs** - Uses native browser APIs instead of heavy third-party libraries

### Share Text Generation

The system generates contextual share text based on:
- Game completion status (won/lost)
- Performance metrics (moves used, efficiency)
- Overall statistics (win rate, streak)
- Personalized messaging for different outcomes

#### Example Share Text (Victory):
```
üéâ I just completed Waffle Game!

üåü Result: Perfect
üìä Moves Used: 8/15
‚ö° Efficiency: 87%
